Beer IOU - Zendcon2011

This application was created for a Zendcon 2011 session, Big Server is watching you.

The goal of the session was to demonstrate some of the common pitfalls, performance hogs that are common in php applications.

Disclaimer: The application is intentionally written with flaws, and was put together quickly for the session. It does not necessarily follow good programming practices, and should not be used as a base for another application. Consider yourselves warned!

Database:
---------
The database used for the project is mysql.
There are 2 files in the /data/ folder of the project: 
beer_iou-schema-only.sql which only holds the mysql schema, no data
beer_iou.sql.gz a gzipeed database dump of the database I used in the presentation

Install:
--------
$ mkdir folder-name
$ git clone git@github.com:mkherlakian/BeerIOU folder-name
Set the document root of your vhost/server to be the public/ folder of the application

Replace the database parameters in the application/configs/application.ini file to match your database
